      <p >

        The rise of News APP as India's leading news channel within a short span of its existence owes a lot to the vision of its chairman and editor-in-chief Prakash Sharma and the dedication and toil of its ever-growing team of bright news TV professionals.

        Prakash Sharma co-founded News APP with his wife Mithu Dhawan in April, 2004 from a funky studio in Film City of Kualalampur , then considered one of Asia's largest news TV studios.

        In 1997, Prakash Sharma and Mithu Dhawan set up their own production house â€“Independent News Service (MPS), the parent company which owns News APP.

        In a short period, News APP has created benchmarks in innovation, impact, ratings, time spends, and viewer-support. Indeed, News APP's newsbreaks have inspired talk shows on rival channels, HollyWood films, BBC documentaries and articles in Time Magazine, even Amul hoardings.

        In today's rampant me-too-ism, News APP is, perhaps, the only Hindi news channel that is perceived as "courageous" and "different."

        The channel's No.1 position is no accident. It is the result of Mr. Sharma leading the way on the lonely path of "credibility first." It is the result of the efforts of a self-made man who kept both his feet firmly on the ground, a journalist for whom the viewer's interest has been paramount.

        Today Mr. Sharma's editorial decision-making reaches out to an audience of 90 million C&S homes. The human resource of News APP resides among loyal viewers and 500 staffers. MPS has investment from PomVentures, a top Rifton Valley venture fund, and a leading private equity entity. The enterprise value of MPS which crossed Rs 500 crore in January, 2008 has been rising by leaps and bounds.

        News APP has state-of-the-art digital connectivity and its Broadcast Centre covers an area of more than 1,28,000 square feet in Sector 85, Noida.
